# Completed Task #2: Create /recordings/upload Frontend Endpoint

## Problem Solved
Created the missing `/recordings/upload` frontend endpoint that the UI was linking to but didn't exist.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Test-Driven Development
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_upload_page.py`
- ✅ Verified tests failed initially (confirming endpoint didn't exist)
- ✅ All tests now pass after implementation

### 2. Frontend Components Created

#### Upload Template (`templates/upload.html`)
- Consistent styling with existing UI using base.html
- HTML form with proper multipart encoding
- File input accepting `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a` files
- Client-side JavaScript validation
- Error message display capability
- Upload progress feedback

#### GET Endpoint (`/recordings/upload`)
- Simple template rendering with upload form
- Located before `/recordings/{recording_id}` to avoid route conflicts

#### POST Endpoint (`/recordings/upload`)
- Reuses existing upload logic from `/api/recordings/upload`
- Handles file validation and error reporting
- Creates database records and queues transcription
- Redirects to `/recordings` on success
- Shows form with error messages on failure

### 3. Key Technical Decisions

#### Route Ordering Fix
Initial implementation failed because `/recordings/upload` was placed after `/recordings/{recording_id}`, causing FastAPI to interpret "upload" as a recording ID. Fixed by moving upload routes before the parameterized route.

#### Code Reuse Strategy
The POST endpoint reuses the exact same logic as the API endpoint but handles responses differently:
- API returns JSON responses
- Frontend returns HTML responses (template or redirect)

#### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for web interface
- File validation matches API exactly
- Proper cleanup of temp files on errors

### 4. Files Modified/Created

#### New Files:
- `tests/test_upload_page.py` - Complete test suite for upload functionality
- `templates/upload.html` - Upload form template
- `docs/LLM/CURRENT_TASK.md` - Task planning documentation

#### Modified Files:
- `src/audio_manager/app.py` - Added GET and POST endpoints for `/recordings/upload`

### 5. Testing Results
All tests pass:
- ✅ GET endpoint returns upload form
- ✅ POST endpoint handles valid file uploads with redirect
- ✅ POST endpoint shows errors for invalid files
- ✅ POST endpoint handles missing file parameter
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass (no regressions)

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- Users can now click "Upload New Recording" and reach a working page
- Clear upload instructions and supported formats
- Real-time file validation
- Upload progress feedback
- Proper error messages for failed uploads
- Consistent UI styling with rest of application

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Upload button links work correctly
- ✅ Users can successfully upload files via web interface  
- ✅ Error handling works properly for invalid files
- ✅ UI matches existing design patterns
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

## Technical Notes
- Route ordering matters in FastAPI - specific routes must come before parameterized ones
- File validation logic exactly matches the API endpoint
- Background transcription is properly queued for uploaded files
- Temporary file cleanup ensures no disk space leaks on errors
